                <p>Compliance reporting is rolling over you soon. Taxonomy, Green Deal, new regulations and the lot.
                    .</p>

                <p>It feels like only big companies have the resources nessecary to report on sustainability. Either
                    way, you probably represent a small-medium sized business interested in commencing sustainability
                    reporting. .</p>

                <p>A recurring comment is "where do I even beging?"</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Your sustainability report is a non-financial report on your company's emissions, strategy,
                        stakeholder awareness, risks, economics and social awareness.</li>
                    <li>You collect data from a variety of sources which - when compiled can work as a guideline for
                        improvement and awareness.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2 id="you-are-a-servant">An overview</h2>

                <p>Your company has stake holders, which consist of management, employers, customers, service providers
                    and other interest groups. <strong> These stake holders are interested in your company's climate
                        values,
                        economic impact, future climate risk, current actions, opportunities and works as a way to
                        insure
                        those stake holders that you are doing the work.</strong></p>

                <p>Your current sustainability report will work as documentation, while the 'green change' progresses.
                    Wether or not your current actions are positive or negative, it is more important that your start
                    documenting. Why? </p>

                <p>Take Europe and its new Green Deal..</p>

                <p>The green deal will work as a classification system, in order to objectively assess company's climate
                    actions. Your stake holders are searching for, actively assessing and make decisions based on
                    sustainable actions taken by your company.</p>

                <p>Conducting a sustainability report provides transaparency for your stake holders, and provide you
                    with data which decisions can be based on. </p>

                <h2 id="serving-yourself-vs-serving-others">Disadvantages of sustainability reporting</h2>
                <h3 id="2">Which reporting-standard to use? </h3>
                <p>We are all missing is a standardized sustainability reporting standard. But, your most important
                    activity now is to start.</p>

                <p>Internationally you have the recognized certificate called ISO 14000, which is "a set of standards
                    created to help companies around the world reduce their adverse impact on the environment". This is
                    a huge and broad topic, with many specific "sub-categories" within the ISO 14000 series.</p>

                <p>Furthermore, withing each nation you have specific certifications which is adapted to national
                    standards. In norway we have a certification called Miljøfyrtårn.</p>

                <p>This certification is old and covers a broad set of social, economic and environmental topics which
                    provides you with a sustainability report. </p>

                <p>Nation-specific reporting standards will grow stronger going ahead. These standards are implementing
                    sustainability reporting rules and regulations, which makes it easier for you to just 'fill in the
                    blanks'. </p>

                <p>You could even break it even further down. An executive decisions on your climate strategy, is in
                    fact a documeneted sustainability effort. Pick a topic on of the 17 UN Goals for Sustainable
                    Development, and do just that! You now have a signed boards decision on sustainability. Sure, it is
                    not a standards - but - it is a start. </p>

                <h2 id="3">Why comply when there's no enforcement? </h2>

                <p>Sustainability reporting is optional, and for the moment you have few reasons to start. </p>

                <p>Depending on your industry, there will be different standards for your company. With the end in mind,
                    as in your financial incentives, ask your bank what they require for green loans. A bank will be
                    able to guide you in a direction which will give you practical answers.</p>

                <p>A local bank in the city Tromsø, Sparebanken Nord-Norge has a sustainability framework which
                    specifies which KPI's, certifications and documentation that makes you eligible for green loans.
                </p>

                <p>As a founder you are a servant to a niche within a market. Your time, energy, focus, ideas, and drive
                    are to give value to your customers, and be compensated a smaller percentage of that value. If there
                    were no compensation, people would not do it (willingly) unless forced.</p>

                <p>If your goal is cheaper loans (green), work bakwards. This will guide you to a reporting standard or
                    nessecary certificate. </p>


                <h2 id="4">Should you make your own emissions report?</h2>

                <p>A norwegian company I spoke with last year - they build bridges - created their own emissions report
                    (greenhouse gas). By working together with their contractor Innovation Norway, they were able to use
                    EPDs, electricity certificate and basic math to provide the nessecary documentation. </p>

                <p>The bridge project they were submitting their emissions report for, was comparing the difference in
                    emissions on a bridge produced in norway and china. </p>

                <p>In simple terms. Emissions for producing a bridge in norway, taking iron from sweden and 'green
                    electricity' i.e hydropower from norway - was comparable to the emissions related to transportation
                    of a chinese bridge. This excluded the production of a bridge in china. </p>

                <p>Even though the bridge was more expensive, the total emissions related to that specific bridge was
                    lower. This example is meant to give you two things.</p>

                <p>You can create your own emissions report if the product you are making, consists of very few
                    elements. </p>

                <p>Producing a bridge with robots demands iron and electricity. </p>

                <p>Of course you'd have aluminium and other essentials, but since they make up less that 1% of the
                    project's materials - you don't take them into consideration. .</p>

                <h2 id="5">You feel its only those with resources that can report on sustainability? </h2>

                <p>It does take time, especially since there are few automations available for reporting sustainability.
                </p>

                <p>The vocabulary is new and actually doing the work can be grudging. But you've already documented your
                    board's decision to do something, right?</p>

                <p>If you break sustainability reporting up in smaller pieces it can become easier. Let's have a look.
                </p>

                <p>An example is to use a ghg-protocol, which is an internationally approved way of calculating your
                    emissions.
                </p>

                <p>Furthermore, you'd decide to only report on scope 1, which is internal emissions. Your own emissions.
                    There are two parametes to this, stationary and mobile combustion.</p>

                <p>For stationary combustion you need: Fuel Type, Fuel Usage and Units for usage (volume or weight).</p>

                <p>Let us say you use Mixed Electricity (Type), then 10 (Usage) and kWh (Units).</p>

                <p>If you plot this into your GHG Emissions Calculation Tool (free online) - you are already documenting
                    your emissions! Way to go.</p>

                <p>You also have Scope 2 and Scope 3, which cover more advanced ways of calculating your emissions - but
                    scope 1 will suffice. </p>

                <h2 id="6">When answered, a usual follow-up is "what goes in a sustainability report?</h2>

                <p>Going forwards. 2030 is the big year. European nations, counties, and municipalities have set goals
                    for reducing their emissions 50% measured against emissions from 1990.</p>

                <p>Government institutions make the heavy lifting and will have to come up with financial incentives
                    which makes your transition from a "brown" to "green" business a pleasure. </p>

                <p>Furthermore investors, [customers, stake holders and employees] demand information and high-quality
                    reporting standards on sustainability.(Arden. Vol 91, Iss 1, 2015). </p>

                <h1>Benefits of sustainability reporting</h1><br>

                <h2 id="7">You don't know where to start? Look to your accountant for help.</h2>

                <p><strong>The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants [] view their function on
                        sustainability
                        accounting and reporting as follows: </strong>"Members in business, industry and government -
                    can add value
                    within their organizations by serving in an integrative role in the value creation process, linking
                    company strategy to sustainability, evaluating risks and opportunities, and providing measurement,
                    accounting and reportins skills (Arden. 2015, 8-12).</p>

                <p>In simple terms. Your accountant knows your company's financials, probably better than anyone else
                    you work with. </p>

                <p>Their role is unbiased and give trust to your financial numbers. So why not non-financial numbers? A
                    new framework was released by the Finnish, Swedish and Norwegian national accountant committee
                    called Nordic Sustainability Reporting Standard (NSRS).</p>

                <p>A simple - as in practical - standard crafted over six or seven years, the executive Chair Tellefsen
                    told me over the phone. This framework will give you the nessecary tools to start straight away -
                    and its freely available online! </p>

                <h2 id="8"> Why should you start reporting now? Trust.</h2>

                <p>Employees, stakeholders, customers and other businesses rely on your transparency. </p>

                <p>With the new introduction of EU's Green Taxsonomy, it will provide a framework and classification on
                    how your company is helping sustainable development. </p>

                <p>Even though there are some loose threads in terms of how to practically do their reporting, you'll
                    get left behind if you don't report on actual numbers. </p>

                <p>What do I mean with left behind? Say you start reporting from today onwards.</p>

                <p>
                    A board meeting will suffice, with an executive order which states you company's climate action
                    going forwards. There are plenty of examples online. What you now have is your first documentation,
                    and it is the documentation your bank, employees, business partners and customers are looking for.
                </p>
                <p>Of course, this is only the first step. But it feels good. You're moving forward. EU's Green Taxonomy
                    is complicated and is meant to 'weed out' greenwashing and give companies like yourself a framework
                    to do the transition.</p>

                <h2 id="8">Improve your sustainability decision making? Learn from Miljø-Norge.</h2>

                <p>Sustainability can introduce innovation and new business opportunities for your company.</p>

                <p>A norwegian company called Miljø-Norge AS, are re-using and re-selling used fire extinguishers.
                </p>

                <p>Their approach has provided them with a circular business model, which extends ife expectancy for
                    fire extinguishers. Well done hey! In addition to reducing pollution and ghg-emissions.</p>

                <p>In addition to potentially give you that competitive advantage in your market. The municipality in
                    Harstad, used a reporting standard called Miljøfyrtårn to uncover high use of electricity in one of
                    their kindergardens compared to others.
                </p>

                <p>Unfortunately Harstad municipality's reporting system doesn't have live data, so they uncovered it by
                    the end of last year. Even though a live feed would have been more helpful, a focus on emissions
                    helped Harstad optimize electricity consumption</p>
                    <br>

<h1>Disadvantages of Sustainability Reporting</h1>

<h2 id="9">Why should you even start, where's the incentives?</h2>

<p>Let's talk money. 
</p>

<p>If we call green loans to be sustainable, and brown loans as being unsustainable - then there isn't any price incentive just yet. Speaking to your loan provider will let you see this first hand. </p>

<p>Furthermore sustainable innovations, products and services are more expensive for now. Yours will be too. </p>

<p>Public tenders. As compliance becomes clearer, you'll have to report, document and submit your emissions. Municipalities and counties will favor those that have the nessecary documentation, since it'll be weighted in the tender. </p>

In Norway, municipalities weigh climate 30% and price 70%. Starting this process now, will make this easier ahead. 

<p>Kick-backs. Documentations such as a signed board document, or a strategic document on sustainability, sustainable certifications such as ISO14001 - or anything which prove your seriousness on climate - is documentation. You've done something. 
</p>

<p>Being able to prove that your company took measures today, could mean that you're eligible for a financial goodies ahead. Besides, it gives you bragging rights. PR, marketing, advertising or any communication that bolsters your brand - will influence your stake holders. What I'm trying to say. It will take time, resources and money to do the work, but it will pay off. </p>


<p>Financial institutions are looking for 'greener' companies, and will transfer money from brown to green loan portfolios. If you document well and spend the time nessecary to comply, you'll benefit with lower rates, tax breaks and better access to capital. </p>

But what if you didn't have to spend much time documenting your efforts? We are working on a tool which will launch this fall.  It will automate the manuel labor associated with sustainability compliance. 

<p>Recieve your emissions live with fresh data available at your fingertips. No more working with last year's data, manuel typing and copy pasting already documented values. </p>

<p>Stay tuned as we build an automated system that takes away uncertanties, and give you the time to work on what matters to your company. Built ontop of Nordic Sustainability Reporting Standard and the GHG-methodology, you recieve a tool which remove time wasters. </p>
